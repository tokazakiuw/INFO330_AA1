# Seattle Apartment Rental Market Database
In this project, we intend to work in the apartment rental industry in Seattle to understand market trends regarding property values and rental rates. From our data, we can investigate how properties differ in pricing across neighborhoods, which properties have the most units, which leases have the highest rent, and other questions as well. Each property has one landlord, but landlords can own multiple properties. For each property, there are multiple units. Each unit can have one or more leases and tenants. Each tenant paysrent for theunit. By leveraging this information and database into our project, renters and real estate professionals can make informed decisions that can lead to more successful transactions and better returns on investments.
